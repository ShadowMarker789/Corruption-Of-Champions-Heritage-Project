# Corruption-Of-Champions-Heritage-Project
Corruption Of Champions, ported to the web from Flash ActionScript 3

***This is a work-in-progress and is not remotely ready or playable yet***

## What is this, and why is this?
Flash becomes increasingly esoteric and harder to work with, and presents a barrier to entry for those who might otherwise enjoy this work of art by Fenoxo. 

I do not wish their work to be lost to the sands of time, hence this project.
